# User Authentication With Passport and Express 4

View the blog post I started with here: http://mherman.org/blog/2015/01/31/local-authentication-with-passport-and-express-4

In order to get a working sample local authentication site up and running do the following:

1. Run `mongod` in a terminal window.
2. Open another terminal and from within the "passportLocalExpress4Example" cloned repo folder run `npm start`.
3. Open a browser and go to "localhost:3000"

In order to change the the MongoDB database being used, simply change the connection string in /models/dbString

Enjoy! :)
